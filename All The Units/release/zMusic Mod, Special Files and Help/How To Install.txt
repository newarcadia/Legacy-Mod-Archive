Create a text file called or use the one provided, doesn't matter much, just a text document; " ModManifest " into the directory "C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\Halo Wars"

The "All The Units" folder can go anywhere. (But I personally like to put mod folders on my desktop to keep track of them.)

Open "All The Units" folder copy it's directory and paste it into "ModManifest.text"  

Example: C:\Users\<Username>\Desktop\All The Units
